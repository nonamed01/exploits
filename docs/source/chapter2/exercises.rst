Chapter2: Exercises
===================

Exercise1 (creativepwning/chapter2/ex1)
---------------------------------------
**Goal:** Consider this is a binary running on a live instance with a custom
libc. You need to find the address of **execve()** first, and then spawn a
shell by calling **execve("/bin/sh\x00",NULL,NULL);**

HTB Finale
----------
Time to practise with a real challenge. Try to solve the retired challenge on
the HTB platform and spawn a remote shell. This challenge is running a custom
libc6 on the live instance. Don't use any other technique, try to solve it
using the techniques described here. If you get stuck, I wrote a exploit you
can use here: **creativepwning/chapter2/HTB-finale-2024.py**. Try your exploit
in local first, then move on to exploit the live instance. You may need to use
a technique described in :ref:`chapter1` to set a particular value into a
particular register. As an extra exercise for you, try to disable the alarm the
program sets. Have fun!
