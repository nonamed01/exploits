# The CreativePwning Project examples

[The CreativePwning Project](https://exploits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

All the binaries, source code, exploits and examples for the project can
be found here.

# How the source code and examples are organized

For each chapter in the book, there's a subdirectory here named after the
corresponding chapter in the book, which in turn is a subdirectory within
the docs/ directory where the source code of the book in RST format resides.
