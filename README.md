# exploits

A collection of exploits and scripts for different reversing/pwning
challenges that I solved using unintended ways ...

The exploits and binaries you can find on this repository are all retired
challenges, so you wouldn't find spoilers or flags for active challenges!

# The CreativePwning Project!

This repository also contains the source code in RST format under **docs**
for **The CreativePwning Project**, available here:

[The CreativePwning Project](https://exploits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

All the binaries, source code, exploits and examples for the project can
be found on **creativepwning** directory also.
